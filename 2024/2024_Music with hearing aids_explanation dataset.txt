Experiment: "Music perception with hearing aids: compression differentially affects musical scene analysis and musical sound quality" submitted to Trends in Hearing

Dataframe from an experiment with 33 participants (hearing aid users).

In this experiment, participants had to complete the same tasks (that is the Göttiger Sentence test, the Musical Scene Analyis test, and a measure for musical sound quality ) under three different conditions: either with hearing aids using fast compression settings, with hearing aids using slow compression settings, or unaided (presentation was counterbalanced across participants). 

The data set looks like this:
MSA_slow = the MSA score of that respective participant (seen in p_id) with the slow compression
MSA_fast = the MSA score of that respective participant (seen in p_id) with the fast compression
MSA_unaided = the MSA score of that respective participant (seen in p_id) without hearing aids
etc.
